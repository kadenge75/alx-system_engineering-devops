Postmortem Report: Outage of E-commerce Web Application
Issue Summary
•	Duration of the Outage:
o	Start Time: June 1, 2024, 14:00 UTC
o	End Time: June 1, 2024, 16:30 UTC
•	Impact:
o	The primary e-commerce web application experienced severe slowdowns, and approximately 80% of users faced difficulties completing transactions. The remaining 20% experienced intermittent issues with page loads.
•	Root Cause:
o	The root cause was an overloaded database due to an unexpected surge in traffic combined with a misconfiguration in the caching layer.
Timeline
•	14:05 UTC: Issue detected by automated monitoring system alerting high latency in database queries.
•	14:10 UTC: Initial investigation by the on-call engineer confirmed database latency issues.
•	14:15 UTC: Notified the DevOps team, and began checking recent deployments and database performance metrics.
•	14:30 UTC: Misleading path: Checked recent code deployments assuming a new feature might have introduced inefficiencies.
•	14:50 UTC: Notified senior database administrator and escalated the incident to the infrastructure team.
•	15:00 UTC: Identified a surge in traffic but did not immediately link it to the caching misconfiguration.
•	15:20 UTC: Infrastructure team discovered the caching layer was not properly handling the increased load, causing excessive database queries.
•	15:30 UTC: Implemented a temporary fix by scaling up database instances and clearing the cache.
•	16:00 UTC: Applied a permanent fix by correctly configuring the cache settings to handle the traffic surge.
•	16:15 UTC: Monitoring confirmed the system was stabilizing with normal traffic and database query performance.
•	16:30 UTC: Officially resolved the issue and declared the end of the outage.
Root Cause and Resolution
•	Root Cause:
o	The e-commerce platform experienced an unexpected traffic surge due to a flash sale campaign that was not properly communicated to the IT operations team. The caching layer was misconfigured, causing it to bypass the cache and directly query the database for a significant percentage of requests. This overwhelmed the database, leading to high latency and slow response times.
•	Resolution:
o	The resolution involved a multi-step approach:
	Initially, additional database instances were brought online to handle the immediate load.
	The cache configuration was corrected to ensure all queries are properly cached and reduce the load on the database.
	A review of the campaign and traffic expectations was conducted to align future operations with IT capacity.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
•	Improvements:
o	Enhance communication protocols between marketing and IT teams to forecast and prepare for traffic surges.
o	Improve monitoring and alerting systems to detect and notify specific cache-related issues.
o	Conduct regular audits of caching configurations to ensure they are optimized for current traffic patterns.
•	Specific Tasks:
o	Patch Cache Configuration: Review and update cache settings to handle peak loads efficiently.
o	Upgrade Monitoring Tools: Implement more granular monitoring for the caching layer and database performance.
o	Training Sessions: Conduct training for the marketing team to understand the impact of traffic surges on IT infrastructure.
o	Traffic Forecasting Tools: Develop or integrate traffic forecasting tools to predict and prepare for high-traffic events.
o	Load Testing: Regularly perform load testing on the entire system to ensure it can handle anticipated traffic spikes.
o	Incident Response Drills: Schedule drills to practice incident response for similar scenarios, ensuring all teams are prepared for swift action.
By addressing these points, we aim to mitigate the risk of similar incidents occurring in the future, ensuring a more resilient and responsive e-commerce platform.
